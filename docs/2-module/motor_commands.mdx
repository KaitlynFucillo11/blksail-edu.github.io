# Motor Control

## Introduction

The motors used in the robot are brushless DC motors.
These motors are controlled by a Electronic Speed Controller (ESC).
The ESCs are controlled by the flight controller, which in turn is controlled by the Raspberry Pi.

## ESCs

The ESCs receive a Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) signal from the flight controller.
This is a signal that is sent at a fixed frequency, but the duty cycle of the signal is varied.
The duty cycle is the percentage of the time that the signal is high.
The ESCs use this signal to determine the speed of the motor.
This is common is RC applications, and is the same way that servos are controlled, see [Servo Control - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Servo_control)

The ESCs are connected to the flight controller using a 3 pin connector.
The pins are labelled as follows:

- `GND` - Ground
- `5V` - 5V power supply
- `S` - Signal

## Motors

The motors are brushless DC motors.
A brushless DC motor is a synchronous electric motor which is powered by direct-current electricity (DC) and which has an electronically controlled commutation system, instead of a mechanical commutation system based on brushes.
In such motors, current and torque, voltage and rpm are linearly related.

We can control the speed of the motor by varying the voltage applied to the motor.
The ESCs do this for us, and we can control the speed of the motor by varying the duty cycle of the PWM signal.

## Flight Controller

The flight controller is a device that is used to control the motors.
It is a microcontroller that is designed to be used in drones.
It has a number of sensors that are used to determine the orientation of the drone.
It then uses this information to control the motors.

The BlueROV2 uses a Pixhawk flight controller.

The flight controller is connected to the Raspberry Pi using a serial connection.
The Raspberry Pi sends commands to the flight controller, and the flight controller sends back information about the sensors.
It uses the [MAVLink](https://mavlink.io/en/) protocol to communicate with the Raspberry Pi.

:::note

In this section, we will use the flight controller to control the motors.
We will be ignoring the sensors on the flight controller, and will be using the Raspberry Pi to control the flight controller.

## Raspberry Pi

The Raspberry Pi inside the BlueROV2 is used to control the flight controller.
It is running a program called [ArduSub](https://www.ardusub.com/) alongside a set of other programs as [BlueOS](https://docs.bluerobotics.com/ardusub-zola/software/onboard/BlueOS-1.1/)
ArduSub is a program that is designed to control underwater vehicles.
It is based on the [ArduPilot](https://ardupilot.org/) project, which is a program that is designed to control aerial vehicles.

From your own RPi, you can control the motors by sending commands to the flight controller.
You can do this by sending MAVLink commands to the flight controller.
We will be using the python library [pymavlink](https://www.ardusub.com/developers/pymavlink.html) to do this.
