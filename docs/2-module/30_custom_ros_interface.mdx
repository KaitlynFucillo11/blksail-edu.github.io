# Using Own ROS2 Interface

## Introduction

In the previous section, we learned how to use ROS2's `mavros` interfaces to communicate with the system.
However, sometimes, we may need to create our own interfaces to communicate with the system.
This section will guide you through creating your own ROS2 interface by analyzing a custom `rosmav` interface.

## Prerequisites

First, let's clone the [`rosmav`](https://github.com/blksail-edu/rosmav) repository and install the necessary dependencies.

```zsh
cd ~/auvc_ws/src
git clone https://github.com/blksail-edu/rosmav
cd ~/auvc_ws
rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src -r -y
colcon build --packages-select rosmav --symlink-install
source ~/auvc_ws/install/setup.zsh
```

:::note

If there are updates in the `rosmav` repository, you can update the repository by running the following command:

```zsh
cd ~/auvc_ws/src/rosmav
git pull
```

:::

## Testing the Interface

After building the `rosmav` package, we can test the interface by running the following command:

```zsh
ros2 run rosmav ros_bluerov2_interface
```

If the command runs successfully, you should see the following output:

```
[INFO] [1721669754.194733875] [ros_bluerov2_interface]: Heartbeat from system 1, component 0
```

:::note

The output may vary depending on the system ID and component ID.
Nothing will be displayed if the system is not connected (to the real robot or simulator).
