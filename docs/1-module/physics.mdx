# Underwater Physics

## Buoyancy

Archimedes' principle states that the upward buoyant force that is exerted on a body immersed in a fluid, whether fully or partially submerged, is equal to the weight of the fluid that the body displaces.
This principle is essential for understanding the physics of underwater vehicles.

The buoyancy force is given by the following equation:

$$
F_b = \rho \cdot V \cdot g
$$

where $\rho$ is the density of the fluid,
$V$ is the volume of the fluid displaced by the body,
and $g$ is the gravitational acceleration.

### Problem 1:

- Write a Python function, `calculate_buoyancy`,
  that calculates the buoyancy force exerted on a object submerged in water.
- The function should take the following arguments:
  - `V`: the volume of the object in cubic meters,
  - `density_fluid`: the density of the fluid in $kg/m^3$.
- Use the formula above to calculate the buoyancy force.
  `g` is a constant equal to $9.81 m/s^2$.
- The function should return the buoyancy force in Newtons.

### Problem 2:

- Write a Python function, `will_it_float`,
  that determines whether an object will float or sink in water.
- The function should take the following arguments:
  - `V`: the volume of the object in cubic meters,
  - `mass`: the mass of the object in kilograms.
- The function should return `True` if the object will float and `False` if the object will sink.

## Pressure

The pressure at a given depth $h$ is given by the following equation:

$$
p = \rho \cdot g \cdot h
$$

where $\rho$ is the density of the fluid,
$g$ is the gravitational acceleration,
and $h$ is the depth.

### Problem 3:

- Write a Python function, `calculate_pressure`,
  that calculates the pressure at a given depth in water.
- The function should take the following arguments:
  - `depth`: the depth in meters.
- Use the formula above to calculate the pressure.
  `g` is a constant equal to $9.81 m/s^2$,
  and the density of water is $1000 kg/m^3$.
- The function should return the pressure in Pascals.
