# Underwater Physics

## Buoyancy

Archimedes' principle states that the upward buoyant force that is exerted on a body immersed in a fluid, whether fully or partially submerged, is equal to the weight of the fluid that the body displaces.
This principle is essential for understanding the physics of underwater vehicles.

The buoyancy force is given by the following equation:

$$
F_b = \rho \cdot V \cdot g
$$

where $\rho$ is the density of the fluid,
$V$ is the volume of the fluid displaced by the body,
and $g$ is the gravitational acceleration.

### Problem 1

- Write a Python function, `calculate_buoyancy`,
  that calculates the buoyancy force exerted on a object submerged in water.
- The function should take the following arguments:
  - `V`: the volume of the object in cubic meters,
  - `density_fluid`: the density of the fluid in $kg/m^3$.
- Use the formula above to calculate the buoyancy force.
  `g` is a constant equal to $9.81 m/s^2$.
- The function should return the buoyancy force in Newtons.

### Problem 2

- Write a Python function, `will_it_float`,
  that determines whether an object will float or sink in water.
- The function should take the following arguments:
  - `V`: the volume of the object in cubic meters,
  - `mass`: the mass of the object in kilograms.
- The function should return `True` if the object will float and `False` if the object will sink.

## Pressure

The pressure at a given depth $h$ is given by the following equation:

$$
p = \rho \cdot g \cdot h
$$

where $\rho$ is the density of the fluid,
$g$ is the gravitational acceleration,
and $h$ is the depth.

### Problem 3

- Write a Python function, `calculate_pressure`,
  that calculates the pressure at a given depth in water.
- The function should take the following arguments:
  - `depth`: the depth in meters.
- Use the formula above to calculate the pressure.
  `g` is a constant equal to $9.81 m/s^2$,
  and the density of water is $1000 kg/m^3$.
- The function should return the pressure in Pascals.

## Equations of Motions (Newton's 2nd Law)

### Translational Motion

Let's look at Newton's 2nd law of motion:

$$
F = m \cdot a
$$

where $F$ is the force applied to an object,
$m$ is the mass of the object,
and $a$ is the acceleration of the object.

### Rotational Motion

Newton's 2nd law of motion can also be applied to rotational motion:

$$
\tau = I \times \alpha
$$

where $\tau$ is the torque applied to an object,
$I$ is the moment of inertia of the object,
and $\alpha$ is the angular acceleration of the object.

The torque $\tau$ is given by the following equation:

$$
\tau = r \times F
$$

where $r$ is the distance from the axis of rotation to the point where the force is applied,
and $F$ is the force applied to the object.

The moment of inertia $I$ is given by the following equation:

$$
I = \sum_i m_i \cdot r_i^2
$$

where $m_i$ is the mass of the $i$th particle,
and $r_i$ is the distance from the axis of rotation to the $i$th particle.

:::info
In our case, we will be dealing with a rigid body.
Therefore, we can use the following equation to calculate the moment of inertia:

$$
I = m \cdot r^2
$$

where $m$ is the mass of the object,
and $r$ is the distance from the axis of rotation to the center of mass of the object.

  - `tau`: the torque applied to the object in Newton-meters,
  - `I`: the moment of inertia of the object in $kg \cdot m^2$.

### Problem 6

- Write a Python function, `calculate_torque`,
  that calculates the torque applied to an object given the force applied to it and the distance from the axis of rotation to the point where the force is applied.
- The function should take the following arguments:
  - `F`: the force applied to the object in Newtons,
  - `r`: the distance from the axis of rotation to the point where the force is applied in meters.
