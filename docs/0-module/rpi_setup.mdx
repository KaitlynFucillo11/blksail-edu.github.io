# Raspberry Pi Setup

During this course, we will be using a Raspberry Pi 4B as our main computer.
This section will walk you through the steps to get your Raspberry Pi up and running.

The Raspberry Pi is a small, single-board computer that can be used for a variety of projects.
It is a great tool for learning about computers and programming, and it is also a great tool for building projects.

## What you will need

- Raspberry Pi 4 (provided by the course)
- a microSD card (provided by the course)
- a USB-C cable (provided by the course)
- a computer with a USB port.

## Setting up the Raspberry Pi

The RPi has a microSD card slot on the bottom.
Insert the microSD card into the slot, and connect the RPi to your computer using the USB-C cable.
The RPi will power on automatically.

:::tip
If you are using a Windows computer, you may need to install a driver for the RPi.
You can download the driver [here](https://modclouddownloadprod.blob.core.windows.net/shared/mod-duo-rndis.zip).

1. Download and extract the zip file.
2. Open `Device Manager` on your computer and locate `COM & LPT ports`.
3. Connect the RPi to your computer and locate the new device (it should be called `COM PORT ...`).
4. Right-click on the device and select `Update Driver Software`.
5. Browse to the folder where you extracted the zip file.
6. Install the driver.

Check that the driver was installed by opening a terminal and running the following command:

```bash
ping backseat.local
```

## Connecting to the Raspberry Pi

Once the RPi is powered on, you can connect to it using SSH.
We will be using Visual Studio Code to connect to the RPi.

1. Open Visual Studio Code.
2. Install the [Remote - SSH](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-ssh) extension.
3. Click on the `Remote Explorer` icon in the left sidebar.
4. Click on the `SSH Targets` icon at the top of the sidebar.
5. Click on the `+` icon at the top of the sidebar.
6. Enter the following command in the input field:

```bash
ssh blue@backseat.local
```

The default password is `iamblue`.

Once connected, you should see a terminal window in Visual Studio Code (bottom).
You can now run commands on the RPi.

For example, you can now run the following command to check the IP address of the RPi:

```bash
hostname -I
```
