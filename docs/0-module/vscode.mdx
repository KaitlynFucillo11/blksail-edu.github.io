# Installation

For this course, you will need a Mac or GNU/Linux machine.

:::note

If you are using Windows, you can run Linux inside Windows thanks to [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install).

## Package Manager

First, let's get a package manager to help install the software that will be needed.

<Tabs groupId="operating-systems">
  <TabItem value="macos" label="macOS">
    macOS doesn't come with a package manager by default, so we will install
    [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/).
    <br />
    <br />
    Open a terminal and run the following command:
    <br />
    <br />
    ```bash /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL
    https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)" ```
    <br />
    <br />
    Once Homebrew is installed, you can install software by running
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="linux" label="Linux"></TabItem>
</Tabs>
